# Artificial-Turf-Study
A script that generates plots for analyzing parameters for optimization of artificial turf design

This matlab script is part of a project conducted by UVA's Center for Applied Biomechanics. It takes data generated by our Kuka KR300 Robot, a load cell, a cleat, and various artificial sports turfs. The lab is researching the injury mechanisms that athletes encounter when playing sports that use cleats.
